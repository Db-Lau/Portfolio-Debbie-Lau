I am a passionate data analyst having experience in both academia and industry in diverse topics. In Göteborgs Universitet, I developed regression models to improve the causal inference of public health and educational policies. While currently in the industry, I continue to use data analytics in the area of supply chain optimization.

Being enthusiastic at the statistical modelling and programming, I enjoy applying these skills to solve realworld questions both at work and leisure. Below shows the directory of repositories I develop during my leisure, and links to my PhD projects.
